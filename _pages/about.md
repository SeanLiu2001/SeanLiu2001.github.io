My name is Sean Liu and I am a PhD student in Cognitive and Brain Sciences in the Engel Vision & Imaging Laboratory, and Attention, Memory, and Cognition Lab 
at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. 
Before joining UMN, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Psychology at Beijing Normal University in 2023. 
My research involves understanding human visual plasticity, especially how the visual system achieves stability 
in a dynamic environment, through a multidisciplinary approach.
